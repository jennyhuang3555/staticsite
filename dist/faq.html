            <h2>What is the Enneagram?</h2>
            <p>The Enneagram is a system of personality typing that describes nine fundamental personality types and their complex interrelationships. It's a powerful tool for personal growth and understanding relationships.</p>

            <h2>How do I find my Enneagram type?</h2>
            <p>While there are many online tests available, the most reliable way to discover your type is through self-reflection, reading detailed descriptions, and possibly working with an Enneagram coach.</p>

            <h2>Can the Enneagram really help my relationship?</h2>
            <p>Yes! Understanding your own and your partner's Enneagram type can provide valuable insights into communication patterns, emotional needs, and potential areas of growth in your relationship.</p>

            <h2>Do I need to be in a relationship to benefit from this site?</h2>
            <p>Not at all! The insights from the Enneagram are valuable for personal growth and self-awareness, whether you're single or in a relationship.</p>

            <h2>Are some Enneagram types more compatible than others?</h2>
            <p>While certain type combinations might have natural chemistry or challenges, any combination can work with understanding and effort. The key is awareness and willingness to grow.</p>
